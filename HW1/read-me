1. the programs are all written in python 3. So, you need to install python version 3 on your system. For Debian based Linux, you can install it by this command: sudo apt install python3
2. There is two python files: App.py and Utils.py. You only need to run App.py
3. The command to run the code is: python3 App.py <algorithm> <mazefile>
4. The value of the <algorithm> is BFS, DFS, BestFirst, AStar or AllPaths. Apply BFS for breadth first, DFS for depth first, BestFirst for greedy best first and AStar for a* search. Apply AllPaths if you want to generate all the unique paths.
5. The value of the <mazefile> is the name of the input file you are trying to test.
6. For example, one complete command can be like this: python3 App.py BFS 6x6Maze.txt
7. The input file must be in the same directory where App.py and Utils.py are located
8. The output file will be produced in the same directory. If the filename is maze.txt and algorithm name is BFS, then the output file will be maze-BFS-solution.txt
9. In the output file, the path sequence is given followed by the total number of expanded states.
10. There is a bash file that can run all the algorithms on all the maze input file provided for the assignment. In Linux, you can run it by this command: ./run.sh
