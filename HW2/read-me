1. the programs are all written in python 3. So, you need to install python version 3 on your system. For Debian based Linux, you can install it by this command: sudo apt install python3
2. There is two python files: ConstraintSolver.py and Utils.py. You only need to run ConstraintSolver.py
3. The command to run the code is: python3 ConstraintSolver.py <algorithm> [<cutoff>] <input>
4. The value of the <algorithm> is BACKTRACK or MINCONFLICTS.
5. The value of the <input> is the name of the input file you are trying to test.
6. For example, one complete command can be like this: python3 ConstraintSolver.py BACKTRACK Zebra.txt
7. The input file must be in the same directory where ConstraintSolver.py and Utils.py are located
8. The output file will be produced in the same directory. If the filename is Zebra.txt and algorithm name is BACKTRACK, then the output file will be output-BACKTRACK-Zebra.txt
9. There is a bash file that can run all the algorithms on all the input file provided for the assignment. In Linux, you can run it by this command: ./run.sh
